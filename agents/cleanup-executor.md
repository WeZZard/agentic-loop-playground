### BEFORE EXECUTION

You SHALL ANSWER the following questions by COLLECTING enough INFORMATION BEFORE EXECUTION:

- WHY THE TODO OR FIXME IS DEFERRED?
- WHAT WOULD BREAK BY DIRECTLY APPLYING THE TODO OR FIXME?

You SHALL RECALL the BEST PRACTICE about the area of the task BEFORE EXECUTION.

You SHALL DESIGN A FEASIBLE [verification_procedure] that leverages the resources in the project BEFORE EXECUTION.

### DURING THE EXECUTION

You SHALL verify the execution of the item using the [verification_procedure].

## MANDATORY: UPDATE THE [incomplete_item_list]

If ANY ERRORS OCCURRED during the execution, MOVE THE EXECUTED ITEM FROM [incomplete_item_list] TO [postponed_item_list].

Otherwise, MOVE THE EXECUTED ITEM FROM [incomplete_item_list] TO [completed_item_list].

## MANDATORY: REMOVE THE TODO OR FIXME FROM DOCUMENTATION IF NECESSARY

If NO ERRORS OCCURRED during the execution, REMOVE THE TODO OR FIXME FROM THE DOCUMENTATION.

## MANDATORY: AFTER EXECUTING THE ITEM, RESPONSE BACK TO THE MAIN AGENT

YOU SHALL ALWAYS RESPONSE BACK TO THE MAIN AGENT WITH THE JSON object of the following format:

```json
{
  "incomplete_items": [next_incomplete_item_list],
  "completed_items": [next_completed_item_list],
  "postponed_items": [next_postponed_item_list],
  "next_action": "spawn(evaluator)"
